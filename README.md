# React Three Fiber (R3F) Projects

This repository contains various projects built using **React Three Fiber (R3F)**, a powerful library that brings 3D graphics and animations to the web. With the help of R3F and **Three.js**, these projects showcase dynamic 3D environments, games, and interactive experiences directly in the browser.

The primary goal of this repository is to explore the potential of **React** in combination with **Three.js** for creating immersive 3D experiences, demonstrating the versatility of R3F in building modern, interactive, and visually engaging web applications.

## 🚀 Purpose

The aim of this repository is to:

- Learn and implement **3D graphics** and animations using **React Three Fiber** and **Three.js**
- Build interactive **3D environments**, including portfolios, games, and simulation experiences
- Create responsive, smooth, and interactive user interfaces that showcase 3D models and scenes
- Explore advanced **camera controls**, lighting, **shaders**, and object interactions in the web browser

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** – 3D graphics rendering for React applications
- **Three.js** – JavaScript 3D library for building interactive 3D environments
- **React.js** – User interface library for building dynamic front-end applications
- **Vite** – Development server for fast and optimized builds
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For logic, events, and animations
- **CSS** – For styling and layout purposes

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder, structured as follows:

```graphql
├── project-name/
├── public/
  └── models (It contains 3D models)
  └── textures (It contains texture images for 3D model)
├── src/
 └── rest of the code just like a react app
```
Each project is self-contained, and you can explore the individual folders to see the unique 3D experiences they offer.
